# Family Tree
### _Create your own family tree_

Family Tree is an app for Android designed to manage family trees.
At the moment it's completely free and open source.

## Features
With Family Tree you can:
- Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, various events, photos and sources.
- Import an existing family tree through a GEDCOM file and modify it as you want.
- Export the family tree you created (via GEDCOM again) to import in every other genealogy program.
- Share a tree with your relatives, letting them improve it and receiving back the updates. Then you can choose whether accept them or not.

Minimum supported version is Android 4.4 KitKat (API 19), maximum is Android 13 Tiramisu (API 33).
The intent is that data structure respects as much as possible the latest version of GEDCOM standard: [5.5.1](https://www.familysearch.org/developers/docs/gedcom/) and possibly also [5.5.5](https://www.gedcom.org/gedcom.html).<br>
Family Tree is strongly based on the library [Gedcom 5 Java](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcom5-java) by FamilySearch.
